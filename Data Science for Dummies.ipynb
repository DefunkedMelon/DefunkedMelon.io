Have you ever wanted to do a \"machine learning\" or a \"big data?\" If so, this tutorial will show you how to get started with the data science pipeline, and will introduce you to industry standard tools for data analytics and visualization. This tutorial assumes you already know a thing or two about python, so if at any point you feel like you don't understand the code it may be wise to brush up on your python knowledge.\n",

At any point you may find yourself having to backtrack and wrangle more data, or collect more data, or wrangle more data. Or wrangle your data some more, and then wrangle it again for good measure. This tutorial can't show you exactly how to do it because the process it totally unique for every dataset you may find yourself working with. This tutorial will give you the tools and outline the process, but you'll have to use your brain to figure out how best to prepare and process your own data. Copying this code won't help you much."

If you are already familiar with jupyter notebooks, and have jupyter installed on your machine you can skip this part and move on to the required packages. These \"notebooks\" are industry standard for data science with python due to their publishability, modular design, and inline data visualization support. You can get basic instructions on how to install jupyter [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), but if you like spoilers and would like to see a much more comprehnsive guide on how to use jupyter you can go [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).

The beating heart of the python science ecosystem is the pandas package. Pandas is a data analysis library that has become ubiquitous in the data science world because of it's fast, well optimized data structures and intuitive design. It's the first thing you want to have installed when you begin any data science project, so if you don't already have it installed in your python envoronment do so now by using pip or conda, depending on your setup.

API stands for application programming interface, and it's one of the nicest ways you can get data. An API is a package or set of instructions released publicly but companies or other organizations that you can use to query data from their web servers. They send you the data, usually in some documented format that you can then parse into your pandas dataframes. Pandas also has functions for importing any csv files you may stumble across online if your data is in a file you can download.
