It's the first thing you want to have installed when you begin any data science project, so if you don't already have it installed in your python envoronment do so now by using pip or conda, depending on your setup.

An API is a package or set of instructions released publicly but companies or other organizations that you can use to query data from their web servers.

    "There we go! One beautiful dataframe ready for visualization and analysis. Just reading my code and instructions it might seem like this process is easy, or at least doesn't take very long. This took me over 6 hours. This forum data is particuarly nasty to wrangle, and figuring out how to parse the information I needed from an API I've never used before with cryptic and many times unhelpful field names was a grueling endevour. For every functioning block of code you see here there were a hundred I deleted. I had to write countless little test blocks to probe the data and see what information was hidden where. The process was made even more difficult by the fact that posts didn't always have the same information fields stored in them so it was easy to run into key errors. What I'm trying to say is that I wasn't joking when I said wrangling is the hardest, most time consuming part of the process. It's a lot of trial and error but pushing through is very rewarding."
